# Final Project
_ By Mee Ho, Madeline Mills, Rachel Foster

## Proposal
I. Data Source:
For our project, DataVoyagers will utilize the NYPD Shooting Accidents dataset. 
The dataset captures detailed information about shooting incidents in New York City, including date, time, location, and other relevant attributes.
Our decision to use this dataset stems from its societal significance, enabling us to explore patterns, trends, and potential insights into the dynamics of gun-related incidents in the city.

II. Research Questions:

- Temporal Patterns: Are there specific times or seasons when shooting incidents are more prevalent?
- Spatial Analysis: Can we identify geographical clusters or hotspots of shooting incidents?
- Demographic Factors: Are there correlations between shooting incidents and demographic characteristics of the affected areas?
- Law Enforcement Response: How effective has the NYPD been in responding to and mitigating shooting incidents?

III. Anticipated Challenges:

- Data Quality: The dataset may have missing or inconsistent entries, requiring thorough cleaning.
- Spatial Analysis Complexity: Mapping shooting incidents geospatially may pose challenges, especially in densely populated areas.
- Demographic Data Integration: Linking demographic data to shooting incidents might require careful handling to ensure accuracy.
- Temporal Granularity: Analyzing temporal patterns might be affected by variations in reporting practices over time.

IV. Expected Results on the Final Day:

- Comprehensive Descriptive Analysis: A detailed overview of shooting incidents, highlighting trends and patterns over time and space.
- Interactive Geospatial Visualization: A dynamic map illustrating the spatial distribution of shooting incidents.
- Demographic Correlations: Insights into potential correlations between shooting incidents and demographic factors.
-Law Enforcement Effectiveness Report: An assessment of the NYPD's response to shooting incidents, potentially identifying areas for improvement.
